    <!--use accordion(collapsible content) to display the listed questions with answers under them respectively-->
    <button class="question">1. What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should
      know about?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <!--create description list to answer the question-->
      <p><dl>
				<dt><strong>Navigation bar</strong></dt>
        <dd>The navigation bar which consists of the 4 main pages was created to make it easier to browse through the website rather than just using the links.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Accordion tabs</strong></dt>
				<dd>The accordion tabs are created to contain the answers for each of the questions listed for higher readability and a neater appearance for user.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Display appropriate messages for mandatory text fields when hover</strong></dt>
				<dd>A brief message is displayed underneath mandatory textfields according to their requirements when hover or clicked on such as 
          status code and status description at post status page and search status page, to ensure correct input from user. This also saves a lot of time 
          and effort as user can avoid submitting wrong input and has to refill the whole form again.</dd>

    <button class="question">2. Which parts did you have trouble with?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        I had issues with storing data into database, particularly date field as mysql only stores date in the Year-month-day format, whereas the required input is
        in date/month/year format. After conducting some research, the issue was resolved by inserting the date following the mysql format, while displaying html side format
         and only convert the date to d/m/Y format when retrieving data to display result.
      </p>

    <button class="question">3. What would you like to do better next time?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        I would like to improve my website design so it will look more appealing and user-friendly. I would also like to explore in using other 
        front end frameworks like Bootstrap for better UI design and styling or Javascript for interactive features.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="question">4. What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <!--create unordered list to answer the question-->
      <p><ul>
				<li>The lecture slides and labs such as for data validation and database connectivity.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp">W3Schools for features reference</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21361333/fetch-current-date-record-of-dd-mm-yyyy-format-in-php-mysql/21361375">Stackoverflow for date format issue</a></li>
			</ul></p>  
    </div>

    <button class="question">5. What you have learnt along the way?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I learnt to code with HTML, CSS and PHP for website design and development, as well as database implementation using MySQL 
        for data storing and data retrieval.</p>
      <p>I also discovered that there are many CSS features (accordion, navigation bar and others) that can be used for the website styling. </p> 
      <p>Moreover, I learnt to be persistent in troubleshooting issues and finding solutions through the right resources.</p>
