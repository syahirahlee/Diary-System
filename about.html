				<dt><strong>Navigation bar</strong></dt>
        <dd>The navigation bar which consists of the 4 main pages was created to make it easier to browse through the website rather than just using the links.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Accordion tabs</strong></dt>
				<dd>The accordion tabs in About page are created to contain the answers for each of the questions listed for higher readability and a neater appearance for user.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Responsive layout and form</strong></dt>
				<dd>The accordion tabs and post status form and search status form are designed and developed to be responsive so they can accomodate to the browser window size.</dd>

    <button class="question">2. Which parts did you have trouble with?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        I had issues with storing data into database, particularly date field as mysql only stores date in the Year-month-day format, whereas the required input is
        in date/month/year format. After conducting some research, the issue was resolved by inserting the date following the mysql format, while displaying html side format
         and only convert the date to d/m/Y format when retrieving data to display result.
      </p>
      <p>Besides that, figuring out the right code styling to ensure form elements are aligned neatly and not disrupt each other when making them responsive.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="question">3. What would you like to do better next time?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        I would like to improve my website design so it will look more appealing and user-friendly. I would also like to explore in using other 
        front end frameworks like Bootstrap for better UI design and styling or Javascript for interactive features.
      </p>

    <button class="question">4. What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <!--create unordered list to answer the question-->
      <p><dl>
				<dt>The lecture slides and labs such as for data validation and database connectivity.</dt>
        <dt>W3Schools for features references:</dt>
				<dd><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">- HTML</a></dd>

    </div>

    <button class="question">5. What you have learnt along the way?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I learnt to code with HTML, CSS and PHP for website design and development, as well as database implementation using MySQL 
        for data storing and data retrieval.</p>
      <p>I also discovered that there are many CSS features (accordion, navigation bar and others) that can be used for a website styling,
        and how each element needs to be meticulous when coding their styling for consistent layout.</p> 
      <p>Moreover, I learnt to be persistent in troubleshooting issues and finding solutions through the right resources.</p>
